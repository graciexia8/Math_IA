# Math_IA
Java Program that calculates the transformation of coordinates in hyperbolic space (using the poincare model and the weierstrass model) and convert back into cartesian plane. This program was required for my internal Assessment in HL Math, which focused on recreated the design "Circle Limit III" by M.C Escher using hyperbolic geometry, tessellations, transformations, matrices and vectors. To view, download repository and view on IDE that supports Java.
